Welcome to the One Match repository.

The associated code is in the project folder:

OM.py – This file contains the One Match (OM) and patient-level classifications (PLCs) code.

CNN.py – This file contains the code for the sequential CNN.

AE.py – This file contains the autodidactic enhanacement (AE) code.

trace.py – This file contains the error traceback code.

Note: We do not include the data here. These files are provided for transparency. They will, however, work just fine on other data if you have your own or get data from Kaggle or something.

The code here is publicly available. I only ask that you reference where you got the code from if you use it for your work.
